densho-api Setup
================

This page documents the process of installing and configuring `densho-api` on an existing Debian Linux machine.

Most of the commands you will type will be entered as `root`.  To become `root`, type the following at a command prompt::

    $ su - root
    [enter root password]

As per convention, variables in this documentation are written in upper case with underscores, starting with a "$" sign.



Automated Installation
======================

In this section we will use a script to automatically install the `densho-api` code and its supporting applications.

Log in to your VM and become `root`.  Then add a `ddr` user, install the prerequisites, and install the `densho-api` app itself.::

    # adduser django
    [enter info]
    # apt-get install git-core
    # git clone https://github.com/densho/densho-api.git /opt/densho-api
    # cd /opt/densho-api

    # If you are testing a branch, switch to that branch.
    # git checkout -b BRANCHNAME origin/BRANCHNAME
    
    # make install

Wait as Make installs Debian packages and Python code and builds up your system.  On a basic VM this takes between 5-10 minutes.


Configuration
=============

The default settings in `/etc/densho/denshoapi.cfg` are specific to the Densho production system.  Settings in `/etc/densho/denshoapi-local.cfg` will override the defaults.

To get the nice Django error messages edit `/etc/densho/denshoapi-local.cfg`.  **WARNING: setting `DEBUG = True` in a production environment is a security risk!**::

    debug=1

Restart the servers and the web application to see the effects of your edits.::

    # make restart
